# Plagiarism Detection Project

## Overview

This project provides a simple method for detecting potential plagiarism by comparing the contents of two text files. Using Python's `difflib` library, it calculates the similarity between the files and estimates the percentage of content that may be duplicated or plagiarized.

## Purpose

The project aims to assist in identifying similarities between text documents, which can be valuable for:
- **Academic Integrity**: Ensuring that academic work is original and not copied from other sources.
- **Content Verification**: Checking for duplication in written content, such as articles or reports.
- **Plagiarism Detection**: Offering a preliminary tool to spot potential plagiarism in textual documents.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the `difflib` library, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## How It Works

The tool reads two text files and calculates the percentage of similarity between them. This percentage indicates how much of the content might overlap, helping to assess potential plagiarism.

## Usage

1. Prepare the text files you want to compare.
2. Run the tool to generate a similarity percentage, which shows the potential overlap between the documents.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Quickly identifies potential similarities in textual content.
- **Simplicity**: Provides an easy-to-use method for preliminary plagiarism detection.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for various contexts, including academic and content creation.
